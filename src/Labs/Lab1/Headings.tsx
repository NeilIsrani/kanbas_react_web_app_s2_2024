Each section is usually prefaced with a short title or heading that attempts to summarize the topic of the section it precedes. HTML heading tags can be used to format plain text so that it renders in a browser as large headings. There are 6 heading tags for different sizes: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest heading.
